# Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns true if a palindrome is found.
# Exit where the array is empty of the input is an integer or float.
# Loop through each string in the array, check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
# If a palindrome is found, return True immediately.
# If no palindromes are found by the end of the loop, return False.
